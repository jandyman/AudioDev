# Python Coding Standards

## Use PEP8, but the the follow exceptions
1. Use a Tab size of 2. 
2. Between Methods in a class, only include one blank line
3. Don't avoid multiple statements on a line if is clear ( a = 4; b = 5 )

## Other
Strive to conserve vertical space. For instance ...
* Use "a = b if cond else c" instead of a standard if 
* Don't shy away from using lambdas
* Use "s" instead of "self" in method declarations and references
* For variable naming, feel free to use short non-descriptive name where local context is clear. The closer the definition is textually, the less a descriptive name requirement applies.
* Use type hints where it is practical
